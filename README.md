## Introduction

This project is a capstone project developed by **Francis Oluwatosin Olasupo** as part of my coursework at **Axia Africa Nigeria**. The Blog Express.js App demonstrates my skills in backend development, RESTful API design, and database management using MongoDB.

## Features

-   **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration endpoints.
-   **CRUD Operations**: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
-   **Category Management**: Organize posts into categories for better navigation.
-   **Commenting System**: Enable users to comment on blog posts.
-   **Search Functionality**: Filter posts based on keywords.

## Technologies Used

-   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server and handling asynchronous operations.
-   **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs, providing robust features for web and mobile applications.
-   **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, simplifying data interaction and schema validation.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and managing blog data, enabling flexible and scalable data structures.
-   **bcryptjs**: Library for hashing passwords, enhancing security by storing password hashes instead of plain text.
-   **jsonwebtoken**: Implementation of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization.
-   **dotenv**: Module for managing environment variables, keeping sensitive configuration details secure and separate from code.
-   **body-parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies, making it easier to work with JSON data.
-   **cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies attached to the client request object, useful for session management.
-   **express-validator**: Middleware for validating and sanitizing incoming data, ensuring data integrity and security.
-   **nodemon**: Development tool that automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected, enhancing the development workflow.
-   **passport**: Middleware for implementing authentication strategies, enabling user login and registration.
-   **passport-google-oauth20**: Passport strategy for authenticating users using Google OAuth 2.0, allowing for easy login via Google accounts.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available in the application:

-   **User Registration**
